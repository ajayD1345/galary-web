        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Hamed Ayojide, and i was a nobody before the gracious light of altschool africa illuminated my
            life, and now i can say with all certainty i have discoverd what was missing, and now am a man that has goals,
            dreams to  be accomplished.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was but an empty shell of doubt suffering from the devastating state of my country,
            the poor economy, and the critical/damaging state of security of the country, leaving not in reality but in 
            my imagination of when I finally leave the country to live the life i always wanted, getting a good job, making
            good money through legal means and enjoying my limited time on this earth before it runs out, but this dream 
            of mine could not be accomplished due to the bad country I was born or so I thought until a friend of mine told 
            me about tech, and how fast tech job are growing and the life of luxury i could attain by learning a tech skill under
            a short period of time and on my own keep on expanding my skills till I become a master in that skill,but reality
            is a savage beast, though what my friend said about tech wasn't wrong, it can only happen through hard work and
            dedication.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went to do my research on how i can attain this tech skill until i stumbled upon an altschool africa 
            post on instagram, seeing all the positive and successful reviews from past student and the new role they all
            occupy due to the knowledge altschool africa impacted on them so I decided to be part of it all and joined 
            altschool africa, Hopefully my dreams will come through and i'll be one day sharing my story to the world 
            of how tech saved my life, and i also dropped the <a href="form.html">link</a>  of the altschool africa application form for those who wants to join or be part of this immaculate journey with me.
